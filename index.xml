Although I haven’t had as much time (yet!) to enjoy the fruits of my labor as I would like, I thought it would be a good to idea to outline my journey - from surfing eBay to scouring my closet for old MacAddict CDs - to any others out there looking to scratch that classic mac nostalgia itch.</description></item><item><title>How I Made This Blog - Part 3</title><link>https://willhonaker.com/2020/01/03/how_blog_3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willhonaker.com/2020/01/03/how_blog_3/</guid><description>I last left off describing how I built this website and pushed it to GitHub for the first time. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve pushed a Hugo site to a GitHub repo, you can turn on GitHub pages and host your site live at username.github.io.
I went with this option initially, but as I went through the process of customizing my site, a lot of sensitive information began to pile up in my config.</description></item><item><title>How I Made This Blog - Part 2</title><link>https://willhonaker.com/2020/01/02/how_blog_2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willhonaker.com/2020/01/02/how_blog_2/</guid><description>Intro Want to make a website with Hugo, just like this one? In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline how I did it, step by step.
Step 0: Conquer your procrastination This step took me a while. Try not to get distracted, and remember that if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time for something, you make time for it.
Stop right there!!
Step 1: Choose a static site generator and a theme As mentioned in the previous post, I wanted a static site generator that could create blazingly fast websites.</description></item><item><title>How I Made This Blog - Part 1</title><link>https://willhonaker.com/2020/01/01/how_blog_1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willhonaker.com/2020/01/01/how_blog_1/</guid><description>Intro When it comes to personal projects, I can be a terrible procrastinator. There&amp;rsquo;s just too many things to do and too many ways to do them - especially for creating a personal blog.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made false starts using all of the following and more:
Blogger Wordpress Squarespace Jekyll Gatsby Pelican A tumblr page A twitter feed From-scratch static HTML hosted on AWS Enigmatic pictures on Instagram Since you&amp;rsquo;re reading this now, you might have inferred that I eventually settled on something - that something is Hugo on Github Pages.</description></item><item><title>Introducing R2Adobe</title><link>https://willhonaker.com/2019/10/27/r2adobe-intro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willhonaker.com/2019/10/27/r2adobe-intro/</guid><description>Placeholder for introducing my Adobe Analytics package.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://willhonaker.com/search/placeholder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willhonaker.com/search/placeholder/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://willhonaker.com/top/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willhonaker.com/top/about/</guid><description> I&amp;rsquo;m William Honaker, and welcome to my blog.
