Once you&amp;rsquo;ve pushed a Hugo site to a GitHub repo, you can turn on GitHub pages and host your site live at username.github.io.
I went with this option initially, but as I went through the process of customizing my site, a lot of sensitive information began to pile up in my config.</description></item><item><title>How I Made This Blog - Part 2</title><link>https://willhonaker.com/2020/01/02/how_blog_2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willhonaker.com/2020/01/02/how_blog_2/</guid><description>Intro Want to make a website with Hugo, just like this one? In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline how I did it, step by step.
Step 0: Conquer your procrastination This step took me a while. Try not to get distracted, and remember that if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time for something, you make time for it.
Stop right there!!

There&amp;rsquo;s just too many things to do and too many ways to do them - especially for creating a personal blog.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made false starts using all of the following and more:
Blogger Wordpress Squarespace Jekyll Gatsby Pelican A tumblr page A twitter feed From-scratch static HTML hosted on AWS Enigmatic pictures on Instagram Since you&amp;rsquo;re reading this now, you might have inferred that I eventually settled on something - that something is Hugo on Github Pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
